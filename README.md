This project provides a maintenance function for a fictional school or college. It allows file maintenance (CRUD operations)
for the list of all Instructors, Students, Courses, and Classroom locations associated with the school. In addition, it provides
for instructors to be assigned a schedule to teach individual courses in specific classroom locations at specified days of the
week and time of day. Once these course schedules have been set up, students are then allowed to be registered to individual
courses.

This application has been built as a Visual Studio 2022 solution, which includes two project types:
1) MVC .Net Core
2) WEB API
Both projects are written in C#. A SQL Server database, including stored procedures, are used to maintain the data.
